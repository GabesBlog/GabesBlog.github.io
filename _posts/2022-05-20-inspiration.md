The [Cradle series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H1CYBS6?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=gabesblog00-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cb5e900ce5cac432deb7984c15525842&camp=1789&creative=9325) is part of the [progressive fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/auscvg/what_is_progression_fantasy/) genre which was inspired by the xianxia genre.

Xianxia is a chinese genre that follows a martial artist (daoist) protagonist on his/her path to immortality.

The [Cradle series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H1CYBS6?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=gabesblog00-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cb5e900ce5cac432deb7984c15525842&camp=1789&creative=9325) follows Wei Shi Lindon, a weak useless martial artist, on his path to greatness and it's quite epic. The fights are extremely satisfying, the plot twists are very well done and the progression is memorable.

The author, Will Wight, started this series because he was reading xianxia books and got tired of waiting for new chapters so he started writing his own.

It motivated me to learn about writing. So I decided to create this blog to track my progress and to share other amazing books with the world.
